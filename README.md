# File Read & Write with Error Handling in Python

This Python program demonstrates file handling: reading content from a file, modifying it, and saving the modified version to a new file. It also incorporates error handling to ensure the program runs smoothly even if there are issues like missing files or unreadable files.

## Features:
- Reads a file specified by the user.
- Modifies the content of the file (in this example, converts it to uppercase).
- Writes the modified content to a new file.
- Handles errors such as file not found or file unreadable gracefully.

## How to Run:
1. Run the program by typing:
   ```bash
   python file_handling.py
